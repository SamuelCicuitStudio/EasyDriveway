# Topology-Only Minimal Web App

This package is a minimal build of the original ICM web UI with **only the Topology page**.
- Same look & layout
- Directly accessible at `index.html`
- Local mock enabled with **16 relays**, **8 sensors**, and **4 PMS** (mapped as `parking` type).

## Run (local)
Just open `data/index.html` in your browser. The mock is already included.
